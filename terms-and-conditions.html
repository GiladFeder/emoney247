    <h2>SECTION 2 : ABOUT MODULR</h2>
    <p>
    About your contract with Modulr<br>
    The purpose of this pamphlet is to highlight the key points which are included within your contract with Modulr (the Modulr Contract). We know that agreements relating to financial services can be complicated so have put together this reference document to help.<br>
    The Modulr Contract may refer to some payment methods, for example CHAPs and the use of cards (Payment Methods), which may not apply to you. If that is the case, then the terms and conditions relating to those Payment Methods do not apply to you.<br>
        <br><br>
    1.Who is Modulr?<br>
    Modulr is not a bank, we are an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) which helps businesses receive and make payments more easily. This is achieved by Modulr providing eMoney247 with access to our technology and our connectivity to various payment systems so that Modulr can then provide its electronic accounts and payment services to you. Modulr carries out several activities which are known as payment services and that means we are required to be authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Modulr’s FCA authorisation relating to its electronic money accounts can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://register.fca.org.uk/s/">here</a> under reference number 900573.<br>
    Why do I need these services from Modulr?<br>
    You are a customer of eMoney247 and as a part of their services you require access to a Modulr electronic money account (Modulr Payment Account) and various Payment Methods, which eMoney247 is not authorised to provide to you directly. eMoney247 works with Modulr to enable you to have access to these regulated services.<br>
    A Modulr Payment Account will allow you to:<br>
    ·Receive payments into this account from an external bank account.<br>
    ·Make payments from this account to another account (whether held or not held by Modulr).<br>
    ·Check the balance and transaction history on the account (when this functionality is enabled on your account)<br>
    Payments will be made using the Payment Methods provided by Modulr (or the external third-party bank).<br>
    Opening your Modulr Payment Account<br>
    What do I need to do to open a Modulr Payment Account?<br>
    Agree to the Modulr Contract. This confirms that you accept the terms and conditions relating to Modulr providing its regulated services to you. By agreeing to these terms, you also agree to Modulr requesting identification documents from you to check your identity. This is something which Modulr is required to do to provide its regulated services to you.<br>
    Once you have signed the Modulr Contract, and Modulr has confirmed to eMoney247 that you have passed Modulr’s identity checks, eMoney247 will open a Modulr Payment Account on your behalf. This is also the time when your Modulr Contract will start. The Modulr Contract will continue until you, Modulr, or eMoney247 asks for the contract to end.<br>
    Once your Modulr Payment Account is open, you will need to follow the requirements of your Modulr Contract. For example, we ask you to keep your security details safe and not engage in fraudulent activity.<br>
    Will Modulr share my information with other people?<br>
    To provide our regulated services to you, Modulr will be required to collect and store your personal information. Sometimes we may need to share this information with others so that we can meet our own legal requirements. Further information on the type of information Modulr collects, why this information is collected and what this information is used for can be found on our privacy policy. If you have consented to another provider (such as an Account Information Service Provider, called a Third-Party Payment Service Provider (TPP)) to have access to data relating to your Modulr Payment Account to enable the TPP to provide services to you, then you consent to Modulr providing the TPP with the data that it needs to provide its services to you. If you no longer consent to Modulr providing data to a TPP, you must let us know as soon as possible.<br>
    Do I need to pay Modulr for my Modulr Payment Account?<br>
    You don’t need to pay any fees to Modulr. Fees may need to be paid to eMoney247, as a part of the services which they provide to you.<br>
    How long will I have my Modulr Payment Account for?<br>
    You will have a Modulr Payment Account for as long as you remain a customer of eMoney247, and you continue to follow the requirements of the Modulr Contract. Of course, if you no longer want to use your Modulr Payment Account, you can close it any time by contacting eMoney247. What if Modulr transfers its rights under the Modulr Contract to another provider? We may transfer some or all of our rights and duties under your Modulr Contract to another service provider in the future, and if we do this, your Modulr Contract will continue with that service provider.<br>
    <br><br>
    3. Making/receiving payments to my Modulr Payment Account<br>
    How long will it take for me to make/receive a payment to my Modulr Payment Account?<br>
    Once Modulr receives an instruction from you or eMoney247 to make a payment from one account to another, we will ensure that the payment transaction is carried out according to the timeframe required by the Payment Method and relevant payment systems. When the payment will be received will depend on the time frame set out by the Payment Method and relevant payment systems.<br>
    Can I cancel payments from or to my Modulr Payment Account?<br>
    You can cancel any transaction which is agreed to take place on a future date, but you must notify eMoney247 as soon as possible. However, we may not be able to cancel the transaction depending on the type of Payment Method used.<br>
    Are there any limits on my Modulr Payment Account?<br>
    Depending on the types of Payment Methods used, there may be limits on your Modulr Payment Account. This will be communicated to you by eMoney247 when your Modulr Payment Account is being set up.<br>
    Requests for payments into your Modulr Payment Account will not be performed if:<br>
    ·Your Modulr Payment Account has reached any limits which may be in place.<br>
    ·Your Modulr Payment Account is blocked or has been closed.<br>
    ·The person making the payment has provided the incorrect account details for your Modulr Payment Account.<br>
    ·We suspect that the payment may be fraudulent.<br>
    In such circumstances the funds may back sent back to the sender without prior notification to you.<br>
    <br><br>
    4.Keeping your Modulr Payment Account and your e-money safe<br>
    How is Modulr different from a bank?<br>
    As Modulr is not a bank, it cannot provide bank accounts. Modulr can’t lend money or use money which it holds for the purposes of lending that money to others. Instead, Modulr provides payment accounts. eMoney247 will provide you with access to our technology, including our connectivity to various Payment Methods so that Modulr can then provide its electronic accounts and payment services to you.<br>
    As the Modulr Payment Account not a bank account:<br>
    Funds in the account will not earn any interest.<br>
    Funds in the account will not be protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), as the FSCS applies only to banks.<br>
    So, how does Modulr protect my money?<br>
    Modulr, as an EMI, is required by law to ensure that your money is protected. This protection is called safeguarding. This means that all the money which you send to your Modulr Payment Account must be protected by Modulr. Modulr does this by opening a separate bank account for its customers with a safeguarding partner in accordance with the relevant law. This bank account will be separate from Modulr’s own funds and will have the same amount of money in it which you have put into the Modulr Payment Account. For example, if £1 is sent to your Modulr Payment Account, Modulr will put £1 into a separate bank account with its safeguarding partner.<br>
    If Modulr is unable to pay its debts, and is required to close its business:<br>
    An independent insolvency professional will be appointed to return your funds to you; and<br>
    The funds in your Modulr Payment Account will be separate from Modulr’s own funds. Therefore, if Modulr owes money to other companies, your funds will not be used to pay this off. However, if Modulr does not have sufficient money to pay for the costs of the insolvency practitioner then their costs may be taken from your funds before your funds are returned to you.<br>
    Further information on Modulr’s safeguarding practices can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://www.modulrfinance.com/blog/a-message-from-modulr-how-we-keep-customer-funds-safe">here.</a><br>
    How do we protect your Modulr Payment Account<br>
    Modulr takes the protection of your Modulr Payment Account very seriously. We have secure systems in place to help us do this and we work with eMoney247 ensure that your personal information and any security details (such as passwords) are kept safe. If you have access to your Modulr Payment Account, you must also keep safe any security details provided to you. You can contact eMoney247 if you have any questions on this.<br>
    What if I notice a payment to or from my Modulr Payment Account which I don’t recognise?<br>
    If you notice that a payment is incorrect, please contact eMoney247. eMoney247 will then contact Modulr on your behalf. Once Modulr has completed its investigation, we may refund or reverse a payment transaction depending on our findings.<br>
