    <p>
        We may disclose your Personal Information with the following categories of recipients: <br>
        Group companies, business partners (i.e. our Partners), service providers and other affiliated third parties:
        who provide data processing services to us (for example, to support the delivery of our site or due diligence

        To any other person with your consent to the disclosure.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>8. Legal basis for processing Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
        Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal
        information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. <br>
        However, we will normally collect personal information from you only <br>
        (a) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, <br>
        (b) where processing is necessary to fulfil a contract with you (such as your prepaid card contract if
        applicable), <br>
        (c) where processing is necessary to fulfil a contract with merchants that we work with, or <br>
        (d) we have your consent to do so. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal
        information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of
        another person (e.g. our legal obligation to carry out appropriate customer due diligence and anti-money
        laundering checks). <br>
        If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contact with
        you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal
        information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal
        information). <br>
        If we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third
        party), this interest will normally be to provide our services to you and for our legitimate commercial
        interest, for instance, when responding to your queries, improving our platform, undertaking marketing, or for
        the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities. We may have other legitimate interests and if
        appropriate we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are. <br>
        If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use
        your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us”
        heading above help@emoney247.co.uk.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>9. Cookies and similar tracking technology</h2>
    <p>We use cookies and similar tracking technology (collectively, “Cookies”) to collect and use personal information
        about you. For further information about the types of Cookies we use, why, and how you can control Cookies,
        please see our Cookie Statement.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>10. International transfers of Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
        As described above, from time to time, eMoney247.co.uk may need to transfer your Personal Information to
        business partners, service providers and other eMoney247 Limited offices that are located in territories outside
        of the European Economic Area ("EEA"). <br>
        Please note that the legal regimes of some territories outside of the EEA do not always offer the same standard
        of data protection as those inside the EEA, although we will ensure that your Personal Information is only ever
        treated in accordance with this Notice and, if you are a customer, our terms and conditions.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>11. How we look after your Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
        We have in place what we believe to be appropriate technical and organisational security measures to protect
        your Personal Information against unauthorised or unlawful use, and against accidental loss, damage or
        destruction. We put in place strict confidentiality agreements (including appropriate data protection
        obligations) with our third-party service providers. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of
        security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information. <br>
        If you or others on your behalf give us any Personal Information about another person, you take full
        responsibility for complying with any relevant data protection laws which apply to the provision of that
        information to us, and our use of it as explained in this Notice.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>12. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
        We retain Personal Information where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to
        provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting
        requirements). <br>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
        anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in
        backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
        processing until deletion is possible.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>13. Updates to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in response to changing legal, technical or business developments. When we update our Privacy Policy, we will take appropriate measures to inform you, consistent with the significance of the changes we make. We will obtain your consent to any material Privacy Policy changes if and where this is required by applicable data protection laws. <br>
        You can see when this Privacy Policy was last updated by checking the “last updated” date displayed at the top of online Privacy Policy.
